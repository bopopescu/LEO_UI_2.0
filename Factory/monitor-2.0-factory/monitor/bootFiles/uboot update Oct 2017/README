This folder contains an updated u-boot.bin and the .sh script to install it.
It was provided because there was a problem with the Chipsee device not being
able to reboot properly from a command line "reboot".

The following is from email exchanges with Nicky at Chipsee (lxq@chipsee.com)

Hi,
To update the bootloader to resolv the reboot issue easily, I build a shell to execute in your now system.
Use follow steps to do it:
    # download the update-uboot-package.tar.gz
    # copy the tar to your ubuntu1204, you can use ssh
    scp update-uboot-package.tar.gz linaro@192.168.x.x:/home/linaro
    # untar the tar package on ubuntu1204, you also can use ssh
    ssh linaro@192.168.x.x
    tar zxvf update-uboot-package.tar.gz
    # update
    cd update-uboot-package
    sudo ./update-uboot.sh
    # reboot to use latest uboot to boot


As for the boot problem, the software used a pin which has been occupied by RS485 output signal.
     So the software reboot may have problem because of RS485 output signal depend on the RS485 BUS.
     So we suggest you update all the product software.
